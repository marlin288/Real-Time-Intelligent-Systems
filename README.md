# Assignment 2: Runtime & Space Complexity in Financial Signal Processing

This repository contains the implementation for **Assignment 2** of the *Real-Time Intelligent Systems* course.

The goal of this assignment is to analyze how different algorithmic design choices affect **runtime and space complexity** in a simplified financial signal processing pipeline. The project implements and compares trading strategies using theoretical Big-O analysis and empirical profiling.
